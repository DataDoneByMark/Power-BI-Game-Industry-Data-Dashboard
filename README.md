This is a power BI dashboard that I created on data set from Kaggle.com involving video game industry sales by region, platform, genre and year.

This dashboard has several tabs created to enable the user to drill down into the data in the following ways:
Sales by year in clustered column chart form with Region and Genre button slicers.
Sales by year with a region button slicer, and two ended time slicer for the year range.
Sales in whole number by region and platform in donut chart form.
Sales in whole number bye genre in funnel chart form.
Cumulative sales totals by all 3 categories of button slicers (genre, region, platform) in clustered bar chart form.
Return on investment bar chart based on a theoretical marketing budget that I randomly generated within a feasible range.
